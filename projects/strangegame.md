I lived in Japan from 2003-2005 and when I came back to the United States, I wanted to capture some of the thoughts I had collected about approaches to modern life. It was liberating to sell almost everything I owned to move to another country, and then once I was there, make adjustments to my own habits. After I became a father, the idea took on additional significance as I thought it could be something that is a document of myself that maybe my sons would appreciate (someday).

Each chapter is only a couple of pages long, with personal anecdotes and experiences, and is annotated with links to relevant websites and videos. It's a quick read.
