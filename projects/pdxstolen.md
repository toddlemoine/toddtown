After one of our cars was stolen, and seeing near-daily postings from other theft victims on the Portland Reddit, I decided to build a site that would let people post their stolen vehicle in a public, medium-term place, as well as let non-victims report sightings of suspected stolen vehicles.

PDX/Stolen is still in beta at the moment. It's basically functional, but there are a handful of things I need to work out before opening it up to the world.

Tech used:

-   Written in Elixir and a wee bit of Javascript
-   Phoenix LiveView for the UI and web server
-   Uses a WASM image processing library
