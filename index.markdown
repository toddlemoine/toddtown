I'm a conscientious developer who cares about accessibility and is keen to work on projects that help people. I've spent most of my career as a front-end engineer building enterprise-scale web applications that did things such as web analytics dashboards, systems requirements management, and content management, among others. I have fullstack experience with JS, Elixir, and Python backends (with node, Phoenix, and Flask, respectively), too.

## Other things I've done

-   I wrote _A Strange Game_, a book about my own take on navigating modern life. I plan to make it available online for free, but for now you can purchase it as an e-book from [ LeanPub ](https://leanpub.com/astrangegame) or [ Amazon ](https://www.amazon.com/Strange-Game-Preparation-rest-your-ebook/dp/B01CIEET5W).

-   A few years ago I created [Slidewriter.io](https://slidewriter.io), a tool for quickly creating presentations in Markdown. You can learn more about it on its [project page](/projects/slidewriter).
