I'm a fullstack and frontend engineer with extensive experience building accessible web apps and usable UIs for enterprise companies. I've helped build streaming analytics dashboards, requirements management systems, and component libraries, supported mountains of legacy code, and migrated from one framework to another. Currently at [Symmetry Systems](https://symmetry-systems.com).

I also wrote _A Strange Game_, a book with my own thoughts on navigating modern life. You can get it at [LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/astrangegame) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Strange-Game-Preparation-rest-your-ebook/dp/B01CIEET5W).
